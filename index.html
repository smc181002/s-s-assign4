              <li class="des-list">
                This is a very intuitive video introducing us to the concept of signals and systems. It stresses the fact that signals and systems are intertwined in our daily lives. 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                Signals and systems are of no use to us individually. We generally use systems to alter the signals in a certain manner – like changing the form of a signal (Ex.: electrical to mechanical), scaling its amplitude, or even modulating it – so that they are of use to us. 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                In real life, a system works in a very complicated manner, with many signals being operated upon; with the possibility of subsystems being integrated into a larger system. 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                However, the simplest form of a system can be understood as an entity which manipulates one or more signal (inputs) to form a certain function, thereby yielding new signals (output). 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                A signal, on the other hand, is a mathematical function that conveys information about some phenomenon. They may be a function of time or any other quantity, and they may be continuous or discrete. But all types of signals are important in real life and the study of S&S.

              <li class="des-list">
                MEMS is quite an important application of Signals and Systems. Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems are a category of devices that are microscopic in nature and mainly constitute electrical sub-systems with moving parts. 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                The video captures the basic information about MEMS. They are produced using a process known as microfabrication. Depending on their functionality, they may gather information about the surroundings (sensors) or may follow certain commands (actuators). 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                In general, they are mainly used for perception and control in modern devices. In this regard, the electrical components process the data collected, while the mechanical parts act on the processed data. 
              </li> 
              <li class="des-list">
                The advantage of MEMS is that they use lesser components than any ordinary electrical system, which increases accuracy and lowers the cost. They find applications in automobile safety systems, video projectors, smartphones and even pedometers.

              <li class="des-list">
                Active SONAR harnesses the property of reflection of sound, and the time is taken for the echo to reach the receiver of the SONAR system, to locate the seabed or a foreign object (enemy submarines, shipwrecks etc.).

                In principle, it is similar to SONAR. However, it uses electromagnetic waves (specifically, radio waves) to detect objects, even in the cosmos. It uses the reflection property in this regard.

                A signal whose amplitude can take any value in the continuous range is called analog signal. The continuous condition is only for the amplitude but the signal can be discrete in the time axis.
